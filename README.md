## The Little Prince

 -The Little Prince, who lives on asteroid B-664, loves Rose. One day, the little prince, learning that Rose was in danger, began a long journey through the Milky Way to save Rose. However, the little prince's spaceship is not that good, so Little Price has to avoid planetary systems (gravitational fields) as much as possible on his way. The picture below is a part of the Milky Way map traveled by the little prince.

 The red solid line is the path that minimizes the number of entry/exit into planetary systems required for the little prince to travel from starting point to the end point. The circles represent the boundary of the planetary system. There are multiple path to go from start to end points, but at least 3 entry/exit of the planetary system is required.

Given the milky way map with coordinates of planetary systems, starting & destination points of Little Prince, let's write a program that finds the path with minimum enter/exits into planetary systems.
